## Create your own

[Our documentation site](https://docs.zap.works/designer/getting-started/) contains a number of detailed articles showcasing how to download your Designer project files and how to edit or create your own launch page.

Please note:the `content.json` file contains your AR content built in Designer. We don’t recommend editing this file unless it’s necessary to do so as small tweaks can cause errors at runtime.
